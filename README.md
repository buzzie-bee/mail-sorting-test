# mail-sorting-test
Proof of concept testing for mail sorting interface using python and kivy.

Uploaded as requested.

For future development I would probably seperate the GUI from the business logic and have something running as a server/api talking to the scanners and a seperate interface built using web tech.

Don't judge this code! Was put together to quickly test the potential.

Didn't put this together with pipenv so no pipfile sorry. Dependencies are:

  - kivy and it's requirements
  - functools
  - pyserial
